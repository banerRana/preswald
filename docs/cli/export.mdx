The `export` command builds your Preswald app into a static site that can be run locally or shared with others.

## Usage

```bash
preswald export
```

## What it does

The export command creates a `dist/` directory containing all the files needed to run your app as a static site. This includes:

- Bundled Python code (via Pyodide)
- Application data and DuckDB queries
- UI components and assets
- All necessary dependencies

## Features

- **Offline Support**: The exported app works offline in any modern browser
- **Complete Bundle**: Includes all Python code, data, and DuckDB queries
- **State Preservation**: Maintains app UI, logic, and reactive state
- **Easy Sharing**: Can be shared as a file folder or embedded in hosting platforms

## Output

The command generates a `dist/` directory with the following structure:

```
dist/
├── index.html
├── assets/
    └── data/
```

## Use Cases

- Deploying to static hosting platforms
- Sharing your app with others
- Running the app locally without a development server
- Creating a standalone version of your application

## Notes

- The exported app maintains all functionality of the development version
- No server-side components are required to run the exported app
- All data processing happens client-side using Pyodide
